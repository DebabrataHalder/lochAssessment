This is a single page web app to represent the profile page of a social media app.
This app focuses on the front end UI design and some functions.
Here the posts of the user, uses reusable React DOM elements.

The "Follow"  button is operational and functional.

All the other buttons that the profile page of any social media app should have , is included .

The posts on the app are for representation purpose only and the data is statically typed as there is no backend to this app.

Once a backend is developed, all the other functions too can be easily added.

To check the codes that I have written, you can go to the "App.js" file in the "src" folder which is in the root directory of this project .

To run this app, make sure there's "node" installed in your computer.

Change director to the project director on the CLI.
Run "npm install"

Run "npm start"

In a few seconds the app should open on your web browser on the local host.
